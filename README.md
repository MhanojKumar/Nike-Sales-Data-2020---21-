# Nike-Sales-Data (2020-21)

## Abstract
<p align="justify">
The dataset includes information on Nike sales in the United States from 2020 to 2021. It includes a number of parameters such as Retailer, Invoice date, Region, State, City, Product, Price per unit, Units sold, Total sales, Operating profit, and Sales method.
In this project, I created a line graph for total sales from January 2020 to December 2021. Created a US map with shades to show which regions had the highest sales from highest to lowest, a pie chart for sales mode (in-store, online, outlet), and a bar graph to distinguish sales by different retailers. Finally, a Dashboard was created to display all of the visualizations together. Slicers were created to filter Years, Regions, and Products to make things more detail-oriented.

Please see the <b>"Nike Products Sales Dashboard"</b> excel file on the repository's main page for more information on the interactive visualizations.
